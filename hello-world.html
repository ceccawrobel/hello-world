<h1> Hello Everybody in the central finite curve </h1>
<h2> A program to greet the planet. </h2>

<p>This page is an attempt to follow instructions for our sorta first class at the Epicodus place. But also greet the finite curve with some Earth slang.</p>

<p>We are going to make a list because it is relevant to today's lesson plan. I personally don't make lists because I'm as basic as a John Deere Lawnmower, but I digress...</p>

<ul>
  <li> English: Hello, world! </li>
  <li> Spanish is a pretty sweet language... however I only speak it at a third grade level so I wont even start today... sorry </li>
  <li> Japanese: Konnichiwa, sekai!</li>
  <li> French: Bonjour!!!!! vanilla a la mode? bon apetite. </li>
  <li> Kinyarwanda: Mwirwe, isi! </li>
  <li> German: Guten tag, Welt! </li>
  <li> Mid Western: well gee golly gosh howdy y'all </li>
</ul>
